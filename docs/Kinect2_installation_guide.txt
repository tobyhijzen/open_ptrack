*** Kinect 2 installation for Ubuntu 14.04 ***
Date: 2015-02-25

Step 1:
Install your graphic card drivers (if not already installed), e.g.:
  
  sudo apt-get install nvidia-331-dev

After the installation, if you are using an Nvidia card, substitute the default OpenCL
libraries (old and not standards-compliant) with the working ones:

  sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev

Step 2:
Install Kinect 2 driver and ROS package

  roscd open_ptrack/../scripts
  chmod +x kinect2_install.sh
  ./kinect2_install.sh


Step 3:
Reboot


Step 4:
Sometimes the Kinect 2 is not working because of some OS parameters
not set. To set those parameters run:

  cd ~/workspace/ros/catkin/devel/lib/kinect2_bridge
  sudo ./kinect2_bridge

This step is just to perform some operations as super-user. After you
launch the executable, an error will pop-up, that is normal.


Step 5:
Test

1. TEST POINT CLOUD:

  roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge.launch

If everything is ok, you should see the Kinect2 point cloud in a RViz:

  rosrun rviz rviz

 - set Fixed Frame as /kinect2_head_rgb_optical_frame
 - add a PointCloud2 visualization and set the topic as /kinect2_head/depth_lowres/points

You can test the point cloud framerate with:

  rostopic hz /kinect2_head/depth_lowres/points 

2. TEST SINGLE-CAMERA TRACKING:

  roslaunch tracking detection_and_tracking_kinect2.launch


NB: tested with Ubuntu kernel 3.13.0-37-generic. There were some USB3 issues with previous versions of the kernel.
